            <p>Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the most ferocious predators to ever walk the Earth. With a massive body,
                sharp teeth, and jaws so powerful they could crush a car, this famous carnivore dominated the forested
                river valleys in western North America during the late Cretaceous period, 68 million years ago.</p><br>
